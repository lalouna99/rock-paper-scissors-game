# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is the first project for The Odin Project's Foundations course. It has been written in JavaScript and HTML.

The `OGindex.html` file contains more comments than necessary, primarily for my own future reference to understand the code. Whereas, `index.html` contains cleaner comments that explain the "why" behind the code rather than the "what."
